#ProjectOverlord

Project Overlord is going to be a NodeJS+Electron based Free-Tier UI for 
Imperium, a Nomic currently under development. Overlord will provide some 
ease-of-use thru premade queires and views, while also supporting the necessary 
tinkering in SQL in order to play Imperium. Eventually it may support more 
advanced use case, but for now the focus will be on the simpler more common 
and static queries.
